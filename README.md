# epigenomic_landscape_human_arterioles
global and promoter-focused chromatin conformation, DNA methylation, and bulk and single-nucleus gene expression in human arterioles or tissue components of human arterioles

In this study, we utilized our experience in arteriolar and functional genomic research to establish an extensive epigenomic landscape for human arterioles. We generated data for global and promoter-focused chromatin conformation, DNA methylation, and bulk and single-nucleus gene expression in human arterioles or tissue components of human arterioles. Integrated analysis of these datasets revealed novel insights into the molecular basis of arteriolar function and the genetic mechanisms underlying the regulation of arteriole-related traits including blood pressue.
